# Methodological note

There are many ways to interpret: _“Hottest in the month”_. In case you’re wondering, here’s how we put together the list:

- Check the most-upvoted list every day this month ([ProductHunt Time Travel](https://www.producthunt.com/time-travel?ref=header_nav))
- Check upvotes _as of the day of collection_ (1st of the following month)
- Select 10 apps with the most upvotes

That means the list is slightly biased towards apps that launched earlier in the month (more time to collect votes). However, since it contains apps from the entire month, we feel that small imprecision is acceptable. Upvote counts are from the day we pulled the data.

We also removed any projects related to NFTs, blockchains, and Web3. If you’re confused why, check out [@web3isgreat](https://twitter.com/web3isgreat) or [@smdiehl](https://twitter.com/smdiehl) on Twitter.
