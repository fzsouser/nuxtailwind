Visual Studio Code is one of the most widely-used source code editors out there, with over 136k stars on GitHub. Its popularity comes about due to its lightness, flexibility, open-source nature, simplicity, and extensibility.

Speaking of extensibility, VSCode has thousands of extensions you can install to ramp up your developer productivity and save yourself from mundane tasks. They are all available in the Visual Studio Code marketplace and the vast majority of them are completely free.

This article looks at 10 powerful Visual Studio Code extensions that significantly improve the web development experience. Example usage and installation links are provided for every one of them.

# 1\. Prettier

[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) is a useful tool that automatically formats your code using opinionated and customizable rules. It ensures that all your code has a consistent format and can help enforce a specific styling convention in a collaborative project involving multiple developers.

The Prettier extension for Visual Studio Code brings about a seamless integration between the code editor and Prettier, allowing you to easily format code using a keyboard shortcut, or immediately after saving the file.

Watch Prettier in action:

# 2\. JavaScript Booster

This extension upgrades Visual Studio Code with code actions to perform common refactoring tasks that occur when programming with JavaScript.

# 3\. ESLint

[ESLint](https://eslint.org/) is a tool that finds and fixes problems in your JavaScript code. It deals with both code quality and coding style issues, helping to identify programming patterns that are likely to produce tricky bugs.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/875/0*pmKcjvD5DGtRc6-s.png)

The ESLint extension for Visual Studio Code enables integration between ESLint and the code editor. This integration allows ESLint to notify you of problems right in the editor.

For instance, it can use a red wavy line to notify of errors:

We can view details on the error by hovering over the red line:

We can also use the `Problems` tab to view all errors in every file in the current VSCode workspace.

# 5\. Live Server

The Live Server extension for VSCode starts a local server that serves pages using the contents of files in the workspace. The server will automatically reload when an associated file is changed.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/875/0*XLmVtZwqg32cpFcS.png)

In the demo below, a new server is launched quickly to display the contents of the `index.html` file. Modifying `index.html` and saving the file reloads the server instantly. This saves you from having to manually reload the page in the browser every time you make a change.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/875/0*4m9dZzmrwspuADrH.gif)

As you saw in the demo, you can easily launch a new server using the `Open with Live Server` item in the right-click context menu for a file in the VSCode Explorer.

Install: [Live Server — Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)

# 6\. CSS Peek

The CSS Peek Extension lets you quickly view the CSS style definitions for various class names and IDs assigned in HTML.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/875/0*HpKRBRx4dxeGbR9X.png)

There are three ways to use CSS Peek:

- You can hold down the `Ctrl` key and hover over a class name or ID to peek at its definition.
- You can use a keyboard shortcut to open a persistent definition window that displays the CSS definition of a class name or ID.
- You can use a keyboard shortcut to navigate to where the definition is located in its CSS file.

Here is a demonstration of all these methods:

# 7\. Intellisense for CSS Class Names in HTML

This extension can work hand in hand with CSS Peek, it provides code completion for the HTML `class` attribute from existing CSS definitions found in the current Visual Studio Code workspace.

Artificial Intelligence continues to increase worker productivity in various jobs, and developers are not left out. IntelliCode is a tool that produces smart code completion recommendations that make sense in the current code context. It does this using an AI model that has been trained on thousands of popular open-source projects on GitHub.

When you type the `.` character to access an object method or fields, IntelliCode will suggest a list of members that are likely to be used in the present scenario. The items in the list are denoted using a star symbol, as shown in the following demo.
